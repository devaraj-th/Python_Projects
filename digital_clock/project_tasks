This project has the following flow
Accept user input on whether he wants to display the 'Digital Clock' or the 'Countdown timer'
If the user selects a 'Digital Clock'
We will display the current time
We will update the current time every 1 second
If the user selects a 'Countdown timer'
We will ask the user for the countdown target time
We will display the time remaining
Once the countdown is complete, we will exit the countdown with a display message
